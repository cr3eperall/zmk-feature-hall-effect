properties:
  matrix-size:
    description: The size of the input matrix as rows x columns, if the data received is outside of the matrix it will not be processed
    type: array
    required: true
  offset:
    description: Offset of the matrix
    type: array
    default: 
      - 0
      - 0
  filter-coefficients:
    description: SOS coefficients for the filter as an array of floats represented as 32-bit hex integers
    type: array
  variable-sample-compensation:
    description: how many fake samples to add when the sample frequency is reduced (e.g. when the switch is idle)
    type: int
    default: 0
  wait-period-press:
    description: the time in milliseconds between samples when the switch is active (when the time between 2 samples is greater than 2 * wait-period-press it will be considered as idle)
    type: int
    default: 1
  working-area:
    description: The working area the sensor, if the signal is outside of this bound, it will not be propagated
    type: array
    default:
      - 150
      - 3150
  sample-div:
    description: lets an input for a key pass only once every `sample-div`*`wait-period-press` milliseconds, (this applies individually to every key position)
    type: int
    default: 1
